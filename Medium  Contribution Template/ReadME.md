## Overview

Thank you for taking the time to contribute back to Carbon! In this folder you will find all the assets and instructions you need to submit an icon. Below are intructions for the icon approval process, from creation to PR.


## Steps to approval

### 1. Icon creation

Use the `Icon Contribution Template` sketch file in this folder to create the icon(s) you would like to contribute back. The sketch file has instructions covering Carbon icon style, file handling, exporting, and drawing tips. 

### 2. Contributor opens an issue purposing the new icon.

Create an issue in the [carbon-icons](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-icons) repo. The following must be included in the issue in order to be reviewed by Carbon:

Issue title should be formatted as `Contribution: icon name`. 

In the description area include:
- Team name
- Icon name and what it is being used for
- Box (or other cloud) link to your completed Icon Contribution Template sketch file. Please make sure the permissions are set so anyone can view and download the icon
- Close-up screen shot of the icon with the pixel grid turned on

A carbon team member will label the issue as `contribution`.

### 3. Carbon Review

A carbon designer will review your icon issue. They may ask you to make changes to fit our style guidelines or fix pixel grid alignment issues. They also reserve the right to not accept the icon if they feel it does not fit a universal need.

### 4. Icon Clean-up
Once the icon has been given the final approval by a Carbon designer, use [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) to clean-up your SVG file. This strips away unnecessary code that Sketch exports with the icon. Upload your icon(s) one at a time to the site and leave the default items checked before downloading the updated SVG file.

### 5. Submission
Zip the entire Icon Contribution template and save it to Box (or your preferred cloud storage). Again add a link to the zipped folder to the original GitHub issue. 

### 6. Create a PR.

Make a PR to add the new icon in the [carbon-icons](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-icons) repo.
If you do not know how to make a PR, view our [instructions](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/design-system-website/wiki/Creating-a-PR). 

Please make sure to include the initial issue number and link in the PR.

### 7. The Carbon team will review the PR
A Carbon developer and a designer will review the contributor's PRs. If any changes need to be made they will comment on the PR, if its ready to go they will approve the PR and merge it.
