# carbon-contribution

Welcome and thank you for contributing to Carbon! This repo is used to track work teams or individuals want to contribute to the Carbon library.

If you are interested in contributing checkout our three design contribution models to see which one your proposal falls into:

* [Light](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-contribution/wiki/1.-Light-Contribution-Model): A small design tweak (i.e. changing a border color)
* [Medium](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-contribution/wiki/2.-Medium-Contribution-Model): Adding to/or changing guidelines, or contributing an icon
* [Heavy](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-contribution/wiki/3.-Heavy-Contribution-Model): Contributing a whole new component to the system

Once you determine which model to follow, open an [issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-contribution/issues) in this repo and a Carbon team member will review it shortly.
